# MyReads Project

This was the final assessment project for Udacity's "React Fundamentals" course. We have been provided with a template HTML and CSS, plus the API to search and retrieve data from the database Udacity provided. The goal was to make the project work using React.

## To get started:

* Make sure that you have node.js installed on your computer (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Clone or download the project
* Go to project's folder using command line
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the server with `npm start`
* npm will start the server and tell you in which address the app runs (most likely, http://localhost:3000/)
* Open your favourite browser (most likely, Chrome/Firefox) and go to that address

## Important
The backend API by Udacity uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
